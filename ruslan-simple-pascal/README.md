# Let’s Build A Simple Interpreter - Guide

## Motivation
The following repository follows the series tutorial "Let’s Build A Simple Interpreter". Since I had zero courses in my university about compilers/interpreters, I always felt that knowledge was missing. Said that, the goal is to learn about the principles behind a compiler/interpreter and exercise those principles with practical exercises.

## ToDo

- [] Implement pascal functions
  - [] Implement pascal function declaration
  - - [] Implement pascal function call
